    "# Research Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the effects on aviation that COVID-19  caused at the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (EHAM) and its most frequented destinations for freight and passenger transport?\n",
    "\n",
    "When COVID-19 became a global pandemic in 2020, the containments plunged the global economy into an unprecedented recession. The magnitude of the economic shock was such that it resulted in unrecognisable data and a \"data fog\" that made it difficult to interpret and, more importantly, to predict. The last two years have been extraordinary, both for global economy and the humanity. While the COVID-19 pandemic now appears to be under control thanks to vaccination programmes, parts of the global economy are not yet fully recovered. As a result of the protective travel restrictions, the aviation sector has been hit harder than many others industries. In this project, our aim was to observe the impacts that covid has had on aviation and in particular, the impacts on Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and its most frequented destinations. This from the perspective of passenger and freight transport.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research question is answered by answering similiar sub-research questions:\n",
    "1. What is the top 5 of frequent destinations for passenger transport from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (2019)?\n",
    "2. What is the top 5 of frequent destinations for freight transport from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (2019)?\n",
    "3. What are the volumes of these top 5's in the last 20 years?\n",
    "4. What is the effect caused by COVID on Amsterdam Schiphol Airport compared to other Dutch airports?\n",
    "5. What is the effect caused by COVID on other specific airports?\n",
    "6. Are there other effects caused by COVID (China comparison)?"

    "While discussing the first research question we noticed that, even though is has been proven that COVID-19 arised in China, the amount of COVID cases are very low. We decided to investige this futher. For the first part of the visualisation, we decided to compare the impact on the transport sector of the start of Covid in the Netherlands and in China. In this way, it will be possible to compare the two situations in order to understand whether the Chinese have really been able to escape Covid and its impacts or not. Indeed, as their number of cases is officially so low, it would be possible to think that their economy has not been impacted. But is this really the case? What were the influences of the covid on the country compared to the Netherlands? We decided to proceed as follows:\n",
    "- First, we will compare the purely covid-related data between the two countries.\n",
    "- Then, we will analyse the behaviour of the transport economy in China in order to compare it to that of the Netherlands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantities cannot be compared as such. After all, China is one of the world's largest powers, which is in no way comparable with the Netherlands. However, it is possible to compare the trend of the different curves when the first wave of Covid appeared (increasing, decreasing, stagnating)."
