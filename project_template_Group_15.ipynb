    "What are the effects on aviation that COVID-19  caused at the Amsterdam Schiphol Airport (EHAM) and its most frequented destinations for freight and passenger transport?\n",
    "\n",
    "When COVID-19 became a global pandemic in 2020, the containments plunged the global economy into an unprecedented recession. The magnitude of the economic shock was such that it resulted in unrecognisable data and a \"data fog\" that made it difficult to interpret and, more importantly, to predict. The last two years have been extraordinary, both for global economy and the humanity. While the COVID-19 pandemic now appears to be under control thanks to vaccination programmes, parts of the global economy are not yet fully recovered. As a result of the protective travel restrictions, the aviation sector has been hit harder than many others industries. In this project, our aim was to observe the impacts that covid has had on aviation and in particular, the impacts on Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and its most frequented destinations. This from the perspective of passenger and freight transport."
